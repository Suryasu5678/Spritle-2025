    Nestl√© Health Science, a leader in science-based nutrition, sought to
    develop an innovative platform that would allow healthcare practitioners to
    provide personalized recommendations for diet, exercise, and supplements
    based on patient-specific data. This data included genetic reports,
    responses from a smart questionnaire, and lab results uploaded by patients.
    The challenge was to seamlessly integrate these data sources into a single,
    user-friendly solution that would empower both patients and practitioners
    with personalized, actionable health insights.
